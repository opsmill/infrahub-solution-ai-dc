## Choosing the Right Approach

Impact: MEDIUM

Infrahub offers three distinct ways to analyze data
and surface findings. Picking the right one avoids
over-engineering simple tasks and under-engineering
recurring ones.

### Why it matters

Picking the wrong tier — manual MCP analysis when a
check is needed, or a check when a one-off question
would suffice — wastes engineering time on the
over-engineered side and creates false-confidence
gaps on the under-engineered side. A policy worth
enforcing every proposed change but only audited
manually drifts the moment attention moves on; a
one-off curiosity reified as a Python check adds CI
surface area for no compliance win. The decision
table below exists so the choice is made on shape of
the question, not on what tooling feels available.

### Decision Table

| Criterion | MCP Analysis (this skill) | InfrahubCheck | Transform + Artifact |
| --------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| **Trigger** | On demand, conversational | Every proposed change | Scheduled or on demand |
| **Enforcement** | None (informational) | Blocks merge on failure | None (output only) |
| **Automation** | Manual (Claude + human) | Fully automated | Fully automated |
| **Output** | Chat response | Pass/fail in pipeline UI | File artifact (JSON/CSV/text) |
| **Setup cost** | Zero | Python + GQL + config | Python/Jinja2 + config |
| **Best for** | Exploration, one-off audits | Ongoing policy enforcement | Recurring reports, exports |

---

### Use MCP Analysis (this skill) when

- You need to answer a one-off question
  ("what's broken right now?")
- You're exploring the data model before writing
  a check or generator
- The policy is informal or still being defined
- You want immediate results without writing code
- The analysis involves reasoning that's hard to
  express as a pure pass/fail rule
- You need to investigate a specific incident or
  change impact

**Example prompts:**

- "Which devices are in the PAR01 maintenance
  window starting tonight?"
- "Show me all BGP sessions missing a
  prefix-list"
- "What services depend on devices in rack
  PAR01-A01?"

---

### Use InfrahubCheck when

- The policy is stable and should be enforced
  automatically
- You want to **block** non-compliant proposed
  changes from merging
- The check needs to run on every change without
  human involvement
- The validation logic can be expressed as
  Python + GraphQL

**Example policies suited to checks:**

- Rack unit collision detection
- Required interface description on all active
  interfaces
- Loopback IP must be from the approved prefix

See `../infrahub-managing-checks/SKILL.md` to implement.

---

### Use Transform + Artifact when

- You need a recurring report (daily, weekly,
  per proposed change)
- Stakeholders need the output as a file
  (CSV, HTML, JSON)
- The report is identical every time it runs,
  just with fresh data
- You want to attach the compliance snapshot to
  a proposed change for review

**Example use cases:**

- Weekly IP address utilization report
- Pre-change device inventory export
- Nightly audit of naming convention violations
  as CSV

See `../infrahub-managing-transforms/SKILL.md` to implement.

### Common Escalation Path

Start with MCP analysis to understand the problem,
then escalate:

```text
1. MCP Analysis
   — explore and define the policy interactively
       ↓
2. InfrahubCheck
   — enforce it automatically on proposed changes
       ↓
3. Transform
   — export a recurring report for stakeholders
```

You don't have to go through all three steps —
stop at whichever level of automation is
appropriate.
