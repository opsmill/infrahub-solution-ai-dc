## Compliance Reporting Output

Impact: HIGH

Clear, actionable output is what makes compliance
analysis useful. Raw violation lists aren't enough —
findings need context, counts, severity, and
remediation hints. These patterns define how to
present compliance results.

### Why it matters

Compliance reports are read by people who skim:
operators triaging a change window, leads deciding
whether to approve, auditors scanning for the
headline number. Burying the answer (count,
compliance percentage, pass/fail) under the raw
violation list makes the report less actionable
because the reader has to reconstruct the summary
themselves, and they often won't. The standard
structure below leads with the policy and the
totals, then drills into per-violation detail with
the IDs needed to remediate — without those IDs the
operator has to re-run the analysis just to find the
objects, doubling the work the report was supposed
to save.

---

### Standard Report Structure

Every compliance report should follow this
structure:

```text
<Title> — <Scope> — <Date>
═══════════════════════════════════
Policy:     <Description of what was checked>
Scope:      <Site / device group / node kind>
Checked:    <N> objects
Compliant:  <N>  (<percentage>%)
Violations: <N>

<Violation Details>

Remediation
───────────
<Actionable next steps>
```

---

### Single-Policy Report

For a focused check on one policy:

```text
Device Naming Convention
  — All Sites — 2026-03-13
══════════════════════════════════════
Policy:     Names must match
            <site><nn>-<role>-<nn>
            (e.g., par01-spine-01)
Checked:    47 devices
Compliant:  43  (91.5%)
Violations: 4

Non-compliant devices:
  ✗ SPINE-01    [id: abc123]
    — uppercase letters,
      missing site prefix
  ✗ spine-01    [id: def456]
    — missing site prefix
  ✗ Leaf_03     [id: ghi789]
    — underscore not allowed,
      mixed case
  ✗ par01-leaf  [id: jkl012]
    — missing sequence number

Remediation
───────────
• Rename affected devices via
  Infrahub UI or:
    mcp__infrahub__node_upsert(
      kind="DcimDevice",
      id="<id>",
      data={"name": "<correct-name>"}
    )
  Note: writes land on an auto-created
  session branch; call propose_changes to
  open them for review, not the default branch.
• Consider adding an InfrahubCheck to
  enforce naming on future proposed
  changes.

### Multi-Policy Summary Report

For a compliance run covering several policies:

```text
Compliance Summary
  — PAR01 — 2026-03-13
════════════════════════════════════
                      Checked Pass Fail Status
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Naming Convention      47      43   4   ⚠ WARN
Interface Desc.       312     298  14   ⚠ WARN
Platform Assignment    47      47   0   ✓ PASS
Loopback IP Space      22      20   2   ⚠ WARN
BGP Peer Count (≥2)     8       8   0   ✓ PASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Overall compliance: 416/436 (95.4%)

Details for each ⚠ check are expanded below.
```

---

### Per-Violation Detail Block

Include enough context per violation to act on it
without re-running the analysis:

```text
  ✗ par01-leaf-07 / Loopback0
    Object ID:   17f3a2c4-...
    Kind:        DcimInterface
    Violation:   IP 192.168.100.5/32
                 not in approved loopback
                 prefix 10.0.0.0/24
    Site:        PAR01
    Fix:         Update IP address to a
                 /32 from 10.0.0.0/24
```

Fields to include per violation:

- **Object name** and **ID** (for direct lookup
  or update)
- **Kind** (so the user knows which Infrahub node
  type to navigate to)
- **Violation description** (what policy was
  violated)
- **Suggested fix** (concrete remediation action)

---

### Severity Levels

Not all violations are equal. Use severity markers
to prioritize:

| Symbol | Severity | Meaning |
| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| `✗ CRITICAL` | Critical | Immediate action required (security risk, data loss risk) |
| `✗ ERROR` | Error | Policy violation that must be fixed |
| `⚠ WARN` | Warning | Deviation that should be addressed |
| `ℹ INFO` | Info | Observation, no action required |

Default: use `✗` for all violations unless severity
levels are explicitly requested.

---

### Remediation Hints

Include a remediation section in every report — a
violation list without a fix path forces the reader
to re-derive how to repair each item, and the
report becomes a problem statement rather than an
action item. Match the remediation to the violation
type:

| Violation Type | Remediation Hint |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Missing required attribute | Set value via UI or `mcp__infrahub__node_upsert` |
| Wrong attribute value | Correct value via UI or `mcp__infrahub__node_upsert` |
| Missing related object | Create via `mcp__infrahub__node_upsert`, then `propose_changes` |
| Naming convention | Rename via UI or update |
| Structural gap (design vs reality) | Run the generator to reconcile, or create manually |
| Recurring pattern | Suggest creating an `InfrahubCheck` to enforce on future changes |

---

### Compact Format for Large Result Sets

When there are many violations, use a compact table
format:

```text
Non-compliant interfaces (14):
Device           Interface  Violation
──────────────────────────────────────────
par01-leaf-01   Eth1/1     Missing desc.
par01-leaf-01   Eth1/2     Missing desc.
par01-leaf-03   Eth1/7     Missing desc.
par01-leaf-05   Eth2/1     Missing desc.
...and 10 more. Use filter
  'site=PAR01, missing_description=true'
  to see all.
```

Limit inline output to 10-15 items; offer to
filter or expand on request.

---

### Exporting Compliance Reports as Artifacts

For repeatable, stakeholder-facing reports, convert
the compliance workflow into a
Transform + Artifact:

```text
Interactive MCP compliance
  → good for ad-hoc, exploratory analysis
InfrahubCheck
  → good for pipeline enforcement (pass/fail)
Transform + Artifact
  → good for scheduled reports, CSV/HTML export
```

See `../infrahub-managing-transforms/SKILL.md` for how to
turn a compliance query into a recurring artifact.
