# Rule: schema-display-labels-deprecated

**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Schema

## What It Checks

Detects usage of the deprecated `display_labels`
field (plural, list format) in schema files and
provides exact migration instructions to the
replacement `display_label` field (singular,
Jinja2 template string). Deprecated since Infrahub
v1.5.

## Why it matters

`display_labels` is on a removal track — every
schema that still uses it loads today with a
deprecation warning and will fail to load
entirely on the Infrahub release that drops the
field. The migration is mechanical (list of
attribute paths to a single Jinja2 template) but
has to happen on the schema author's clock, not
under upgrade pressure with the platform refusing
to start. Flagging this at audit time also gives
the engineer the exact replacement string to
paste, which removes the most error-prone part of
the migration — getting the `{{ }}` delimiters
and separator characters right per field.

## Checks

1. Scan all schema files for any node or generic
   containing the `display_labels` key
2. For each occurrence, flag as HIGH severity — this
   field will be removed in a future release
3. Generate the exact `display_label` Jinja2
   replacement based on the list contents

## Migration Patterns

### Single attribute

**Before:**

```yaml
display_labels:
  - "name__value"
```

**After:**

```yaml
display_label: "{{ name__value }}"
```

### Multiple attributes

**Before:**

```yaml
display_labels:
  - "form_factor__value"
  - "sfp_type__value"
```

**After:**

```yaml
display_label: "{{ form_factor__value }} {{ sfp_type__value }}"
```

### With relationship traversal

**Before:**

```yaml
display_labels:
  - "device__name__value"
  - "name__value"
```

**After:**

```yaml
display_label: "{{ device__name__value }}>{{ name__value }}"
```

## Conversion Algorithm

1. Remove the `display_labels` key entirely
2. Create a `display_label` key with a single Jinja2
   template string
3. Wrap each former list item in `{{ }}` delimiters
4. Join multiple items with a space separator (or `>`
   for hierarchical relationships — use judgement
   based on context)
5. The result is a single string, not a list

## Validation

Run `infrahubctl schema check <path/to/schema/files>`
to confirm the migrated schema is valid.

## Common Issues

- Leaving `display_labels` as-is — currently works
  with a deprecation warning but will break in a
  future Infrahub release
- Forgetting the `__value` suffix inside Jinja2
  templates — the template uses the same path syntax
  as the old list items
- Using a list for `display_label` instead of a single
  Jinja2 string — `display_label` takes a string,
  not a list
