## Create the Import Branch Before Validate or Load

Impact: CRITICAL

Run `infrahubctl branch create <name>` **after** the
local self-check passes and **before**
`infrahubctl object validate` or `object load`.
Both commands fail if the branch doesn't exist.

"Branch-first" is a *principle* — every write targets
a branch, never the default — not a *step order*. The
branch is created late on purpose (step 11 of the
workflow), just before validate/load, so a failed
emission never leaves an orphan branch behind. The
shared principle lives in
[../../infrahub-common/rules/workflow-branch-for-crud.md](../../infrahub-common/rules/workflow-branch-for-crud.md);
this rule fixes *when* the branch is created.

### Why it matters

Create the branch AFTER the self-check so a
shape-error emission doesn't leave an orphan branch
on the server. The default branch is never the
target — a partial load is one `branch delete` on a
dedicated branch versus per-object cleanup on the
default branch.

### Before running these commands

- Confirm the server is reachable
  (`infrahubctl info`). See
  [../../infrahub-common/rules/connectivity-server-check.md](../../infrahub-common/rules/connectivity-server-check.md).
- Use the project's Python environment when
  invoking `infrahubctl` (`uv run …`, `poetry run …`,
  or direct PATH — detect once and use for all
  commands below). See
  [../../infrahub-common/rules/connectivity-python-environment.md](../../infrahub-common/rules/connectivity-python-environment.md).

### The commands

```bash
# 1. After the local self-check passes:
infrahubctl branch create csv-import-20260621-1430

# 2. Validate the emission against the branch:
infrahubctl object validate ./output_dir/ --branch csv-import-20260621-1430

# 3. Load on success:
infrahubctl object load ./output_dir/ --branch csv-import-20260621-1430

# 4. If anything fails partway, discard the branch:
infrahubctl branch delete csv-import-20260621-1430
```

Never load to the default branch. Object load is
not transactional across files — a partial failure
leaves the branch in a mixed state. On a dedicated
branch cleanup is one `branch delete`; on the
default branch it's per-object cleanup. The shared
branch-first rule is
[../../infrahub-common/rules/workflow-branch-for-crud.md](../../infrahub-common/rules/workflow-branch-for-crud.md).

### Common mistakes

- **Running `object load --branch my-branch`
  without creating `my-branch` first.** The load
  fails with branch-not-found.
- **Creating the branch before the self-check.**
  Leaves orphan branches when the self-check fails.
- **Trying to resume a partial load.** Not
  supported. Discard the branch, re-run with a
  fresh branch name.
