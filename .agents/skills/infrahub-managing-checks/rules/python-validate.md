## Python Check Class and Validation

Impact: CRITICAL

The `validate()` method is where all check logic
lives, and the choice between `log_error()` and
`log_info()` is what decides whether the proposed
change can merge.

### Why it matters

Infrahub counts ERROR-level log entries after
`validate()` returns: one or more `log_error()` calls
mark the check failed, which blocks the proposed
change from merging until a human fixes the data.
`log_info()` produces messages that surface in the UI
but do not affect pass/fail. There is no
`log_warning()` method — reaching for it raises
`AttributeError` and the check fails with a traceback
instead of the intended validation message. The
`data` argument is the unpacked GraphQL response (the
SDK already strips the outer `"data"` key), so
indexing it as `data["data"]["..."]` returns `None`
and silently passes everything.

### Basic Structure

```python
from infrahub_sdk.checks import InfrahubCheck


class MyCheck(InfrahubCheck):
    query = "my_query"  # Must match .infrahub.yml

    def validate(self, data: dict) -> None:
        edges = (
            data
            .get("MyNodeKind", {})
            .get("edges", [])
        )

        for edge in edges:
            node = edge["node"]

            if something_is_wrong:
                self.log_error(
                    message="Problem description",
                    object_id=node["id"],
                    object_type=(
                        node["__typename"]
                    ),
                )

            self.log_info(
                message="Everything looks good"
            )
```

### Logging Rules

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Method | Effect | Use For |
| ------ | ------ | ------- |
| `self.log_error(message, object_id=None, object_type=None)` | **Causes check to FAIL** | Validation failures |
| `self.log_info(message, object_id=None, object_type=None)` | No effect on pass/fail | Informational messages |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

There is no `log_warning()` method. Use `log_info()`
with a "WARNING:" prefix for non-failing warnings.

### Key Rules

- `validate()` can be sync or async -- the SDK handles
  both
- Always include `id` and `__typename` in your GraphQL
  query for error logging
- Any `log_error()` call means the proposed change
  cannot merge
- The `data` parameter is the unpacked GraphQL response
  (the `"data"` key is already extracted)
