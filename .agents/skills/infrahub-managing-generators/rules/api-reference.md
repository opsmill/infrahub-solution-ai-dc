## InfrahubGenerator API Reference

Impact: HIGH

The `InfrahubGenerator` base class exposes the
constructor parameters, instance properties, and
methods listed below — using them as documented is
what keeps a generator runnable both locally
(`infrahubctl generator`) and inside the proposed
change pipeline.

### Why it matters

`self.client` is the tracking-enabled client; using
the wrong attribute (e.g., `self._init_client`)
creates objects outside the tracking group, so they
never get cleaned up on re-runs and accumulate as
orphans. `convert_query_response=True` is what
populates `self.nodes` with SDK objects — without
it, code that iterates `self.nodes` silently sees an
empty list and the generator produces nothing.
Overriding anything other than `generate()` (for
example, replacing `run()`) bypasses the tracking
context entirely and disables idempotent cleanup.

### Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `query` | `str` | required | GraphQL query name |
| `client` | Client | required | SDK client |
| `branch` | `str` | `""` | Branch name (auto-detected from git) |
| `root_directory` | `str` | `""` | Repo root path |
| `params` | `dict` | `None` | Query parameters |
| `convert_query_response` | `bool` | `False` | Convert response to InfrahubNode objects |
| `execute_in_proposed_change` | `bool` | `True` | Run in Proposed Change |
| `execute_after_merge` | `bool` | `True` | Run after merge |

### Instance Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `self.client` | `InfrahubClient` | Tracking-enabled client |
| `self.nodes` | `list[InfrahubNode]` | Converted SDK node objects (populated when `convert_query_response=True`) |
| `self.related_nodes` | `list[InfrahubNode]` | Nodes sharing the same parent or group relationship as the target |
| `self.store` | `NodeStore` | Populated on collection |
| `self.branch` | `str` | Current branch name |
| `self.root_directory` | `str` | Repository root path |
| `self.logger` | `Logger` | Operation tracking |
| `self.params` | `dict` | Query parameters |

### Key Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `async generate(data: dict) -> None` | Override this method to implement Generator logic |
| `async collect_data()` | Executes the GraphQL query automatically |
| `async run(identifier: str, data: dict \| None = None)` | Orchestrates the full Generator run |
