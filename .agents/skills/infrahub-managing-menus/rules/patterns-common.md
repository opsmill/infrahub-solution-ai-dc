## Common Menu Patterns

Impact: LOW (reference patterns)

### Why it matters

These patterns are the recurring shapes that work
in practice. Picking one as a starting point is
cheaper than designing a menu structure from
scratch — and lifts the three boilerplate comments
(`$schema`, `.infrahub.yml` registration,
`include_in_menu: false` advice) that every menu
file should ship with.

### Flat Menu (No Nesting)

For simple projects with few node types:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server:
#   $schema=https://schema.infrahub.app/infrahub/menu/latest.json
#
# Register this file in .infrahub.yml:
#   menus:
#     - menus/menu.yml
#
# Set include_in_menu: false on schema nodes in this
# menu to prevent duplicate sidebar entries.

apiVersion: infrahub.app/v1
kind: Menu
spec:
  data:
    - namespace: Dcim
      name: Devices
      label: Devices
      kind: DcimDevice
      icon: "mdi:server"

    - namespace: Location
      name: Locations
      label: Locations
      kind: LocationGeneric
      icon: "mdi:map-marker"

    - namespace: Organization
      name: Manufacturers
      label: Manufacturers
      kind: OrganizationManufacturer
      icon: "mdi:factory"
```

### Direct Link to Generic Node List

```yaml
- namespace: Location
  name: AllLocations
  label: All Locations
  kind: LocationGeneric    # Shows all types in one view
  icon: "mdi:map-marker"
```

### Commented Out Items

Use YAML comments to temporarily hide menu items:

```yaml
children:
  data:
    - namespace: Dcim
      name: Switch
      label: Switches
      kind: DcimSwitch
      icon: mdi:switch

    # - namespace: Dcim
    #   name: Interface
    #   label: Interfaces
    #   kind: DcimInterface
    #   icon: mdi:ethernet
```
