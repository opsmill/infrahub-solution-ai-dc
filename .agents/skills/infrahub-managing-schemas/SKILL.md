# Infrahub Schema Creator

## Overview

Expert guidance for designing and building Infrahub
schemas. Schemas are YAML files defining nodes (concrete
types), generics (abstract base types), attributes,
relationships, and extensions.

## Project Context

Existing schemas in this project:
!`find . -name "*.yml" -path "*/schemas/*" -o -name "*schema*" -name "*.yml" 2>/dev/null | head -20`

Infrahub config (if present):
!`cat .infrahub.yml 2>/dev/null || echo "No .infrahub.yml found"`

If invoked with arguments (e.g., `/infrahub:managing-schemas Ipam Vlan VlanGroup`),
use the first argument as the namespace and remaining arguments as node names.

## When to Use

- Designing new data models or schema nodes
- Adding attributes or relationships to existing schemas
- Setting up hierarchical location trees or component/parent patterns
- Configuring display properties (human_friendly_id, display_label)
- Migrating or refactoring existing schemas
- Debugging schema validation errors

## Rule Categories

| Priority | Category | Prefix | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| CRITICAL | Branch-First Changes | `workflow-` | Load schema onto a branch, not the default branch |
| CRITICAL | Naming | `naming-` | Namespace, node, attribute naming |
| CRITICAL | Relationships | `relationship-` | IDs, peers, component/parent, on_delete |
| HIGH | Attributes | `attribute-` | Defaults, dropdowns, computed Jinja2, branch-agnostic, deprecated |
| HIGH | Hierarchy | `hierarchy-` | Hierarchical generics, parent/children |
| HIGH | Display | `display-` | human_friendly_id, order_weight, menu placement |
| MEDIUM | Extensions | `extension-` | Cross-file via extensions block, artifact targets |
| MEDIUM | Uniqueness | `uniqueness-` | Constraint format, __value suffix |
| MEDIUM | Migration | `migration-` | Add/remove attributes, state: absent |
| HIGH | Validation | `validation-` | Load-time string-length caps (description / label / identifier), common error messages, pre-check checklist |

## Schema File Basics

```yaml
---
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.infrahub.app/infrahub/schema/latest.json
version: "1.0"

generics:      # Abstract base definitions (shared attributes/relationships)
  - ...
nodes:         # Concrete object types
  - ...
extensions:    # Add attributes/relationships to existing nodes from other files
  nodes:
    - ...
```

Always include the `$schema` comment for IDE validation.
Only `version` is required at the top level.

## Designing for Downstream Consumers

A schema node rarely lives alone. Before finalizing it,
walk through how it will be used by other parts of the
project and add the inheritance / configuration that
those features require:

| If the node will... | Add to the schema | See |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | --- |
| Be the target of an artifact (group member referenced by an `artifact_definition`) | `inherit_from: [..., CoreArtifactTarget]` on the concrete node | [rules/extension-artifact-target.md](./rules/extension-artifact-target.md) |
| Be the target of a generator (group member referenced by a `generator_definition`) | `inherit_from: [..., CoreArtifactTarget]` on the concrete node | [rules/extension-artifact-target.md](./rules/extension-artifact-target.md) |
| Appear in a custom sidebar menu | `include_in_menu: false` so the auto-menu doesn't duplicate the manual entry | [../infrahub-managing-menus/rules/schema-integration.md](../infrahub-managing-menus/rules/schema-integration.md) |
| Be cloneable as an object template | `generate_template: true` | [rules/extension-object-template.md](./rules/extension-object-template.md) |
| Store an uploaded file (PDF, image, Visio, KMZ, contract, …) | `inherit_from: [..., CoreFileObject]` on the concrete node | [rules/extension-file-object.md](./rules/extension-file-object.md) |
| Be displayed with a stable name across UI lists and APIs | `human_friendly_id` and `display_label` | [rules/display-human-friendly-id.md](./rules/display-human-friendly-id.md) |

This audit is the difference between a schema that
"validates" and one that "actually works in the broader
project." Skipping it forces a schema migration once the
downstream feature is wired up — at which point the data
is already loaded.

When the task spans multiple skills (schemas + transforms,
schemas + menus, etc.), load both skills' rules together
rather than treating the boundaries as exclusive.

## Design for the cheaper layer

A schema choice can remove the need for Python or
denormalized data downstream. The schema is the cheapest
place to get this right — fixing it later means a
migration on already-loaded data. Before adding a field or
node, check whether a built-in or structural feature
already covers it:

| Signal | Cheaper layer | See rule |
| ------ | ------------- | -------- |
| Copying a value onto a node that's reachable by traversing a relationship (`region_code` when `device.location.region.code` exists) | An indirect relationship traversal; let consumers follow the link | [yagni-denormalized-vs-indirect-relationship](../infrahub-auditing-repo/rules/yagni-denormalized-vs-indirect-relationship.md) |
| Several sibling nodes repeating the same attributes and relationships | Extract a generic and `inherit_from` it | [yagni-duplicate-shape-not-extracted-to-generic](../infrahub-auditing-repo/rules/yagni-duplicate-shape-not-extracted-to-generic.md) |
| Defining custom IP address / prefix / VLAN nodes | `inherit_from` the built-in primitive (`BuiltinIPAddress`, `BuiltinIPPrefix`, `IpamVLAN`) | [yagni-custom-domain-primitives-instead-of-builtin](../infrahub-auditing-repo/rules/yagni-custom-domain-primitives-instead-of-builtin.md) |
| An `Attribute` + `cardinality: one` relationship with no inverse on the peer | Declare the matching inverse so consumers filter in the query, not in Python | [yagni-missing-inverse-forces-python-filter](../infrahub-auditing-repo/rules/yagni-missing-inverse-forces-python-filter.md) |

These are the schema-side counterparts to the "Before
writing Python" guidance in the checks, transforms, and
generators skills. The repo auditor flags them as advisory
cost-to-fix findings; catching them at design time avoids
both the finding and the later migration.

## Workflow

Follow these steps when creating or modifying a schema:

1. **Gather requirements** — Identify the node types,
   their attributes, and how they relate to each other.
   Ask about hierarchies, dropdowns, and display needs.
2. **Read relevant rules** — Read
   [rules/naming-conventions.md](./rules/naming-conventions.md)
   for naming constraints,
   [rules/attribute-defaults-and-types.md](./rules/attribute-defaults-and-types.md)
   for attribute kinds and defaults, and
   [rules/relationship-identifiers.md](./rules/relationship-identifiers.md)
   for bidirectional relationship setup.
3. **Build the schema YAML** — Start with the `$schema`
   comment and `version: "1.0"`. Define generics first
   (if any), then nodes. Apply naming, display, and
   relationship rules from step 2.
4. **Audit downstream consumers** — Walk the table in
   "Designing for Downstream Consumers" above. If any
   node will become an artifact or generator target, add
   `CoreArtifactTarget` to its `inherit_from` now, per
   [rules/extension-artifact-target.md](./rules/extension-artifact-target.md).
   Adding it later forces a schema migration on loaded data.
5. **Configure display properties** — Set
   `human_friendly_id`, `display_label`, and
   `order_weight` per
   [rules/display-human-friendly-id.md](./rules/display-human-friendly-id.md)
   and [rules/display-order-weight.md](./rules/display-order-weight.md).
6. **Validate and roll out on a branch** — Run
   `infrahubctl schema check` to fix errors per
   [validation.md](./validation.md) and
   [rules/validation-common-errors.md](./rules/validation-common-errors.md).
   Then apply the change on a dedicated branch, not the
   default branch (`main` by convention, but it can be
   renamed): `infrahubctl branch create <name>` →
   `schema check --branch <name>` →
   `schema load --branch <name>`, and merge via a proposed
   change once it looks right. A schema load runs
   migrations against loaded data immediately, so on a
   shared server the default branch gives no preview and no
   per-step undo — the branch does. See
   [rules/workflow-branch-first.md](./rules/workflow-branch-first.md).
   The default branch is only reasonable on a local
   throwaway instance.

## Production Patterns Worth Knowing

Seven recurring patterns — computed Jinja2 attributes,
cascade-vs-no-action deletes, menu visibility,
branch-agnostic identity, artifact targets, object
templates, and file objects — are documented at the top
of [examples.md](./examples.md). Read those before
finalizing a schema; each pattern is easy to miss
when building from scratch and expensive to retrofit
after data is loaded.
