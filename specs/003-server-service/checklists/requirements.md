# Specification Quality Checklist: Connect L2/L3 Servers to Leaves via a Server Service

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- Source PRD included Implementation Decisions and Testing Decisions sections; these were intentionally deferred to `/speckit-plan` to keep the spec focused on WHAT/WHY rather than HOW.
- Entity names in Key Entities are described in domain terms; concrete schema kinds/roles (e.g. `ServerService`, `NetworkServer`, `server_p2p`) are captured in the source PRD and belong in the plan.
